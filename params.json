{"tagline":"Graphing levels of air pollution in Chinese cities","google":"UA-37666330-1","name":"Chineseair","body":"# Chinese Air\r\n\r\nReports of high levels of air pollution in China are nothing new, but [recent reports](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21007893) have startled many. These are reports of air quality levels so low that even the usually docile citizenry has begun to protest. \r\n\r\nThe United States Embassy runs [a twitter account](https://twitter.com/BeijingAir) which tweets the current levels of air pollution in Beijing. The values tweeted are points on the (Air Quality Index)[http://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi]. Apparently the authorities have threatened to shut it down multiple times but not yet followed through.\r\n\r\nI think it's a great idea, and decided to graph the data as it's rather tough to digest in tweet form. This graph will update hourly, just as the twitter feed does.\r\n\r\n## Current Pollution Levels\r\n<div id=\"chineseair_graph\"></div>\r\n\r\n## About me\r\n\r\nI'm [Aengus Walton](http://ventolin.org), a software engineer from Ireland, currently living in Germany.
